# 🕷️ Web Crawler

A lightweight, Python-based web crawler designed to recursively scan and analyze websites for data extraction, link discovery, and basic site structure mapping. Ideal for cybersecurity assessments, educational purposes, or as a foundational component for more advanced data mining tools.

## 🔍 Features

- Recursive URL crawling with depth control
- Duplicate URL detection and prevention
- Configurable user-agent header
- Simple and readable console output
- Lightweight and dependency-free (built on Python standard libraries)

🚀 Usage

Run the crawler script from the command line:

python crawler.py

You may edit the script to modify the starting URL or crawling depth.

🛠️ Customization

To change the starting URL or behavior:
	•	Modify the start_url and max_depth variables in crawler.py
	•	Enhance with modules like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy if HTML parsing is needed
	•	Integrate logging or export results to a file or database

🧠 Use Cases
	•	Cybersecurity Reconnaissance – Discover site structure during initial scans
	•	SEO Audits – Map out links and page connections
	•	Learning Tool – Great starting point to understand how crawlers work
